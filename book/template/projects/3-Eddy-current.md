## Eddy Current

## Brief Description
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddy current testing (ECT) is a simple and highly sensitive non-destructive testing (NDT) technique used for near-surface inpsection of flaws.  ECT has its roots in Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831, which laid the groundwork for understanding how changing magnetic fields can induce electric currents in conductive materials. This principle was further explored by David Hughes in the late 19th century, whose early work on inductive balances paved the way for practical applications in metal detection and non-destructive testing. In the 1920s Victor de Forest and John H. Schulz made significant advancements building on these foundational principles, establishing ECT as a crucial method for detecting flaws in conductive materials. While the early focus was on testing railroad tracks and aircraft components, more widespread applications have since emerged, from pipeline inspection to evaluating complex aerospace structures including carbon fibre composites.

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eddy-current testing team has experience inspecting a wide range of materials, using a range of measurement techniques including harmonic, chirped and pulsed excitation, and specialises in the use of LC resonant ECT measurements to achieve high-contrast imaging. We also have expertise in array sensor design and in-line monitoring, and build upon the whole research group’s expertise in phased arrays to create new capabilities in the control of particles using sound waves.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is known for their work on resonant ECT and carbon-fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites, as well as the development of novel data-analysis processes and finite element modelling techniques. </p>

## Research Topics
### Current

 - <ins>**ECT of Carbon Fibre Composites**</ins> 
*<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High Frequency ECT can be used to inspect carbon fibre composites due to the electrical properties of the carbon fibres themselves. ECT inspections can therefore provide detailed meso-scale information about the electrical propoerties of the composite structure which cna be linked to the mechanical properties.  </p>*


 - <ins>**Resonant Sensing and Arrays**</ins>
*<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resonant inductive sensing techniques have been shown to improve measurement signal-to-noise ratios through exploiting the effects of electrical resonance on ECT sensing and has been applied to defect detection and carbon fibre composite fibre orientation identification in NDT. Current research in this area is seeking to extend our understanding of resonance in inductive arrays for various engineering applications.</p>*
