## Eddy Current Testing

## Brief Description
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddy current testing (ECT) is a simple and highly sensitive non-destructive testing (NDT) technique used for near-surface inpsection of flaws.  ECT has its roots in Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831, which laid the groundwork for understanding how changing magnetic fields can induce electric currents in conductive materials. This principle was further explored by David Hughes in the late 19th century, whose early work on inductive balances paved the way for practical applications in metal detection and non-destructive testing. In the 1920s Victor de Forest and John H. Schulz made significant advancements building on these foundational principles, establishing ECT as a crucial method for detecting flaws in conductive materials. While the early focus was on testing railroad tracks and aircraft components, more widespread applications have since emerged, from pipeline inspection to evaluating complex aerospace structures including carbon fibre composites.

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eddy-current testing team has experience inspecting a wide range of materials, using a range of measurement techniques including harmonic, chirped and pulsed excitation, and specialises in the use of LC resonant ECT measurements to achieve high-contrast imaging. We also have expertise in array sensor design and in-line monitoring, and build upon the whole research group’s expertise in phased arrays to create new capabilities in the control of particles using sound waves.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is known for their work on resonant ECT and carbon-fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites, as well as the development of novel data-analysis processes and modelling techniques. </p>
