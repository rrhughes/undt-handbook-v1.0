## Laser Room

## Brief Description
<!--The BLU (Bristol Laser Ultrasound) Team tackles the challenges associated with remote non-destructive evaluation, where the transmission and the reception of ultrasonic signals are achieved using lasers. The non-contact, couplant-free nauture of laser ultrasound enables inspection in hazardous environment (high temperature, radioactive), and the flexibility of laser scanning allows the inspection of complex geometries. This is a collaborative project with University of Strathclyde.-->

The laser room is set up for the laser ultrasound non-destructive evaluation technique, which is contactless and couplant-free compared to conventional PZT ultrasonic transducers. There are a generation laser (Class 4) and a detection laser (Class 3R) in the room.
