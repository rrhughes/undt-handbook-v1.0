# Database Structure

When you log in, you will be greeted by the `Samples` table. Along the top, you are able to navigate to the `Materials` and `Equipment` tables, as well as a list of all of the `Suppliers` and `Users`.

Each table contains records of everything we use in the UNDT lab - to make this a valuable resource for the group, it is important to keep it up to date.

The `Samples` table lists all of the samples we use for inspection, `Materials` contains information about each type of material - this is less useful for our purposes but may contain useful information such as data sheets. `Equipment` records all of the devices, equipment we have in the lab, which is useful for tracking ownership of borrowed equipment, and to determine most recent users when looking for a device. `Suppliers` is a list which can be used to lookup connections we have to acquire new samples or equipment, and `Users` contains a list of everyone with access to the database to contain contact information.

## Searching the table

Within each table, you are able to view the full list of all records we have of samples in the lab. When looking for a specific item, you can search by keyword using the search bar.

You are also able to filter the table by field value - for example, to find samples which are used for eddy current testing, set the drop down box under `Test` in the `Samples` table to `Eddy Current`.

## Viewing a record

Any field which is coloured in blue can be clicked to open the record of that item - for example, clicking on the material `Al2024` in a sample record will open the `Al2024` material record.

Within this record, all of the relevant details can be found. If you are the owner of this record (i.e. you are the researcher associated with this sample, material, etc.) then you are able to make changes to this record and save it - this will be covered in more detail in the next section on adding a new sample.

You are also able to save the record to a PDF, which may be useful when sending samples to external researchers, and print a label. The first time this is used you will have to set up the label printer on your device. This label is to be adhered to the sample or device, and contains the ID and primary researchers associated with it, to make it easier to look up the record in the table and find the people associated with it.
