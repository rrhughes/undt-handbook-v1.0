### What our Group does
The Ultrasonics and Non-Destructive Testing (UNDT) group undertake internationally leading research into the fundamentals and applications of ultrasonics. With six core members of academic staff and a dedicated team of 25 PhD/EngD students and research associates, we have a diverse range of projects underway and are always open to new ideas and collaborations.

Check out our [`Projects`](projects/index) and our useful [`Resources`](resources).

### Why do we have a group handbook?

We have a group handbook to:
- Ensure that everyone in the group can find everything they need easily 
- Share resources with others 
- Introduce ourselves and our research areas to potential collaborators and new group members
- Do our project management openly 
- Be explicit about our roles and responsibilities
- Foster a culture of healthy working
- Help everyone to feel included in decision making and lab culture (which is why we created this together)
